// Fetches the ArcFace recogniser (InsightFace buffalo_l / w600k_r50) into
// apps/server/models/face/.
//
// The file is 167 MB and lived in git-LFS until every image build pulling it
// exhausted the repository's LFS budget — the checkout failed before anything
// compiled, so no image was published at all. It now lives on a GitHub release
// (a plain asset download, outside the LFS quota) and is fetched here: during
// the Docker build, and by developers who want the gallery face scan locally.
//
// The small detector (det_500m.onnx, 2.5 MB) stays in git — it costs nothing to
// carry and keeps the models directory non-empty in a fresh clone.
//
// Usage:  node scripts/fetch-face-model.mjs [--dest <dir>] [--force]
// Env:    FACE_MODEL_URL overrides the download source (air-gapped builds, mirrors).
